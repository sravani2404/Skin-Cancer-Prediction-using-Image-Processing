1.importing the packages
2.exploring the dataset - Skin lesion Classification Data
3.Image Processing using opencv
4.Data Extraction and splitting the data
5.Building the Model
	- SVM
	- Decision Tree
	- Random Forest
	- MLP
	- Voting Classifier
6.Image  processing using Image Data Augmentation for CNN
7.Data Extraction to Train and Test 
8.Model building
    - VGG16
    - MobileNet
    - CNN
    - Cascaded CNN - Torch
9.Training the Model with Train and Test
10.here MobileNet gives better accuracy aroubd 90% comparing with others propsed
models only 5 epochs
11.Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
12.User gives input 
13.the given input is preprocessed for prediction
14.trained model is used for prediction for about image 
15.final outcome is displayed through frontend

Extension - VGG16 and MobileNet model is used as extension  along with RF, Voting, SVM, DT
where MobileNet model gives better accuarcy comparing all other model and used to predicting the
user inputs for analysis
